# Week 1 — App Containerization

# REQUIRED Homework/Tasks
Following the live streamed Week 1 Video about App Containerization, I was able to complete the required assignment with slight challenges, but I was able to scale through.

## Created Dockerfile into the backend-flask folder and copied code into the file

```
# This image is fetched from Docker Hub
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# Create this directory within the container 
WORKDIR /backend-flask

# Copy this file from your computer to the container: source -> destination 
# This file contains the libraries needed to run the app
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

# Run this cmd in the container 
# This is to install the python libraries needed for the app
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Copy everything in the current directory to the container 
COPY . .

# Set env variables in the container 
# This is a way to configure our environment
ENV FLASK_ENV=development

# This will expose our app port 4567 
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# -m means to use the flask module
# --host=0.0.0.0 is for setting the port in the container 
# --port=4567 is for setting the app port
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]

```

# From the Dockerfile I was able to build a container inside with these commands.

```
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask

```
