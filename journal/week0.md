## Recreating Conceptual and Logical Diagrams in Lucid Charts

I was able to create my own conceptual and logical diagrams using the lucid chart environment.
This was possible due to the live stream of Week 0 hosted by Andrew and the guest speakers,
And also follow up videos on his youtube channel talking about recreating diagrams on Lucid Chart.
Also i was able to come up with my own napkin design for my diagrams.
Here are my links to show that i did do the diagrams on lucid.
